Changes Made to the ZeOS Kernel:

1. Implemented the macros RESTORE_ALL and EOI in entry.S to restore the context and signal the end of an interruption, respectively.
2. Implemented the clock_routine
    1. Added the clock_routine function in interrupt.c to display the clock information.
        - Also declared in interrupt.h.
    2. Added the clock_handler in entry.S to handle clock interrupts and call the clock_routine.
    3. Initialize the entry of clock interrupt in the IDT[32] in interrupt.c 
        - With setInterruptHandler(32, clock_handler, 0);
    4. Enable the clock interrupt (timer) in hardware.S by enabling the corresponding bit in "enable_int" function.
